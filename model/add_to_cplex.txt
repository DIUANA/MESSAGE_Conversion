* CPLEX LP solution method
* see https://www.gams.com/help/topic/gams.doc/solvers/cplex/index.html#CPLEXlpmethod

*Specifies which LP algorithm to use. If left at the default value (0 for automatic), 
*and a primal-feasible basis is available, primal simplex will be used. If no primal-feasible basis is available, 
*and Threads is equal to 1, dual simplex will be used. 
*If Threads is greater than 1 and no primal-feasible basis is available, the concurrent option will be used.

*Sifting may be useful for problems with many more variables than equations.

*The concurrent option runs multiple methods in parallel. 
*The first thread uses dual simplex. The second thread uses barrier. 
*The next thread uses primal simplex. Remaining threads are used by the barrier run. 
*If the aspect ratio (number of columns versus number of rows) is large, and if more than 10 threads are available, 
*then concurrent optimization also invokes sifting on the LP. 
*The solution is returned by first method to finish.
* 0     Automatic
* 1     Primal Simplex
* 2     Dual Simplex
* 3     Network Simplex
* 4     Barrier
* 5     Sifting
* 6     Concurrent

*threads --> number of parallel threads allowed for any solution method.
*epopt --> feasibility tolerance
